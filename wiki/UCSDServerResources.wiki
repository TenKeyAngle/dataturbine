#summary What sort of servers are available at SDSC/UCSD

= Introduction =

We have a couple of public servers at SDSC/UCSD, these pages detail what we have, IPs, machine types, configurations, etc.


== niagara.sdsc.edu ==

Sun T2000, 32 cores, 16GB of memory, quad gigabit ethernet, with a Caen 9TB SATA-to-SCSI RAID chassis. Physically located in Calit2 (Atkinson) Hall, first floor machine room. Pictures to be posted.

niagara has 4 IPs on 4 different interfaces:
 * niagara Main, production use
 * niagara-stage.sdsc.edu Mid stage between development and production
 * niagara-dev.sdsc.edu Development instance, may be down at any time

All have DataTurbine instances running on them, 4GB of memory each. All have the RAID chassis for archiving, which means that they can hold a *lot* of data.

*IPs here!*

OS is Solaris 10 2/08, with the RAID chassis formatted as a single ZFS container. 

To-do
 * Format the second 73G system disk - mirror? More space? Backup?
